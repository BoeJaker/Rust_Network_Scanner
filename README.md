# Rust Network Scanner

A quick and simple network scanner in rust.

This is my first rust project, the primary goals of this projects are as follows
- Learn more about rust, RAII, threading and async
- Implement a scanner that is quicker and quieter than nmap?

At the moment there are two version single ip scan and multi ip scan, they allow me to explore the different implementations

No SYN or ACK is implemented at the moment, this scan is LOUD.
